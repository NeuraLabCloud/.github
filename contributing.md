## How to contribute

There are 2 ways you can contribute to Whisper Room. The first way is to fork any public repository and make a pull request. You can upload any of your code changes such as bug fixes, new features, etc.

The second way is to join the project group as a member, and help us develop the project. You can help us develop the project by helping us with the code, or by helping us with the design. You can also help us by helping us with the documentation, or by helping us with the marketing.

The first option is what we recommend for anyone who simply wants to contribute to the project without having any responsibilities. Being a member is only for developers who want to help us develop the project long term and grow as a company. For more information about becoming a member, please contact us at.
